A football analyst, to me, is someone who can take something complex, simplify it, and build a case off it, brick by brick. Kind of like a lawyer. You get one example, then another, then another, and then at the end you present your case.

<!---more--->

Brick by brick, you build a wall of important information. Something that you can apply to the team or, in the case of those that create content online, educate the reader.

That is why you see a lot of quote-on-quote "micro-analysis" from me. A term, I agree, applies, but the word "micro" almost implies that it is insignificant information. It may seem insignificant on its own, but I like building that case. Some bricks are smaller than others, but when you follow along and put it all together, you eventually see my point.

I don't withhold information because I'm not under a deadline, and I'm impatient. I want to share that information as quickly as I can. Withholding that information would produce a longer read, thousands of words long, but I don't see the value in delaying the sharing of ideas. I'm not rushing the process; I just don't see myself changing my mind if I took more time on each idea.

We associate more words with a piece being better studied or researched. You can put in the same amount of work and have it be concise and short. I am more impressed when someone can say something simply.

Sometimes it takes one brick, sometimes it takes a dozen. As long as the point is made, why waste more of your time?
