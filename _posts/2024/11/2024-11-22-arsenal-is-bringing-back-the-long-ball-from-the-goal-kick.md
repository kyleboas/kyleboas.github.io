How can anyone criticize Arsenal for kicking the ball long 70% of the time? What is the purpose of assembling a team that can win every aerial duel if you are afraid to kick it long?

I saw this stat in a piece by [The Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/carragher-message-arsenal-fans-long-ball-stat-jose-mourinho-claim-b1194774.html):

> Analysis by The Athletic has revealed that Arsenal kick the ball long (at least 40 meters) at goal kicks 70% of the time, which is the most of any Premier League side this season. Everton is second with 63%, and Nottingham Forest is third with 57%.
> 
> By contrast, City kicks the ball long 25% of the time, Liverpool do it 16% and Tottenham has never done it this season.

I will repeat that again: *Tottenham have never done it this season.* That is a remarkable stat, and I donâ€™t think it is a knock on their forwards, although none of their forwards are good in the air. It is a decision from the team that comes from the top.

Getting the ball from point C, skipping point B, the shorter pass, and choosing to go Route 1 rather than passing out from the back is unique. It is an edge. 

An edge is something that you can do that no one else can. Arsenal can score from almost any corner kick. That is an edge. Arsenal should be able to win every kick long. That is an edge.

Why would anyone discourage them from taking advantage of their edge?
