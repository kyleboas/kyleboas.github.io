The way Racing Santander spontaneously prepares not just for the next pass but also organizes and orients their bodies for the third or fourth pass forward is the reason why they are one of the main relational teams to watch. Their minds are exceptional.

This is a great example from a match back in October against Real Zaragoza. I assigned each player a number because, for this example, it will help you track their movement. The idea behind each movement is more important today.

And yes, the elephant in the room. Why am I watching a random La Liga 2 match from a month ago? Racing Santander is one of the relational teams to watch. I have created a page of interesting teams to watch.

First, the center-back waits. Most would immediately pass to **Player 1**, but they want to organize in a way in which they can go from back to front quickly. In a flash. They don’t wait around in the midfield; they go.

The important player to watch is **Player 4**. They wait for **Player 4** to get into position behind **Player 1** before starting their move, because he is then open in that pocket of space to receive the ball from **Player 2** or **Player 3**. 

All four players, advanced ahead of the ball, are aligned and open to receive on the first or second touch, but players will use that touch to draw in defenders to provide more space to the next player(s).

Once the pass forward is open and played, then your attention can turn to the triangle that forms ahead of the ball between **Players 3, 4, and 5.**

With four quick passes, Racing Santander has worked the ball from the back to the front and in on goal past Real Zaragoza's somewhat compact defense. As compact as most organized defenses are.

These quick combinations can only happen because these players are thinking three steps ahead. This is a way of playing that promotes communication.

There are dozens of other examples in each of their matches.
