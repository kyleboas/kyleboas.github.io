No matter how experienced you are, you have to admit that the world of football is intimidating. Everyone should be comfortable being vulnerable and admitting that to be true. Even the best of the best at the top of the game must feel that same feeling.

That is where perfectionism comes from. The urge to want to be your best only happens by seeing others succeed around you. 

There are thousands of people that know better than I do. That is why I ask them questions. I read their detailed work with animated examples, annotated pictures, and well-thought-out theories. It is intimidating.

If there is no one to push you off the ledge and attempt to be better than the rest, then what is the point of trying?

That is why we remain engaged online, because you need to stay involved to get that inspiration.

The world of football is intimidating, but everyone passed the level you are at right now somewhere in their long journey.
