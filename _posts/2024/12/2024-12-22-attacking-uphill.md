"I am sick of the team having to score two goals every game," says the fed-up fan of a team on a long losing streak that has yet to get a clean sheet. This is the mindset you have to have to win a domestic league title.

This isn't a call for teams to be "defensive first" because I absolutely despise watching teams that play with that mindset.

A lot of teams aren't built to be defensive, nor should they be. A lot of coaches like to attack first, and that should be encouraged because who would prefer there be fewer goals?

To win titles, you need consistency. If you can't consistently limit the opposing team to one goal or less, then you will need to average two goals or more to be sure that you will win.

If you are conceding an average of two goals or more, you are in trouble. Now the fans expect you to score three goals and that isn't sustainable.
