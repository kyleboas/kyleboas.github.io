I think this is what makes Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou relatable for some because he wants to be remembered. Many of us are not comfortable with being unmemorable.

Ange Postecoglou when asked if he sees himself as a messiah of some sort:

> "I don’t think I’m an evangelist; to quote Monty Python, I’m just a naughty ­little boy. It’s what I love about football. There has got to be ­differences, people who are prepared to do things a little bit differently. That allows opinion and emotion.
>
> "We all want to leave a little bit of a footprint on our journeys. I want that to be my footprint – that I was successful in a different way because that stays in people’s consciousness longer than doing things normally.
> 
> "It's a bit of human nature but I don’t think we know what we want. We get something and we want ­something more. Whatever makes you happy, hold on to it, ­cherish it and embrace it. We’ve all got that uncle who, even on the best day, says it’s raining outside. Even though we’ve just won the lottery, we have to share it with someone because two people won it."

"There has to be differences, people who are prepared to do things a little bit differently." That is a key quote.

While others are happy fitting in, the remarkable ones must stand out. And if you want to stand out you have to stray from the norm.

The problem with wanting to stand out in football is that the crowd will constantly want you to copy what works, but sometimes the crowd does not know what is good for them.

Ange Postecoglou on being entertaining:

> "I ­genuinely believe that a big part of our game is — maybe entertainment is the wrong word, but you go to the game to feel emotions that in your day-to-day existence you don’t get the opportunity to — both ­exhilarating and anxious. That’s what we love about it. There’s a lot of suffering in there but if you come out on the right side it’s an exhilarating feeling."

"I go to the game to watch my team win," the crowd member chanting outside the owner's house says after their team loses seven straight.

I would only consider Ange to be "brave" if I didn't think Tottenham could win playing the way they play.
