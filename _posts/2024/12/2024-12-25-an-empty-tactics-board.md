Remove the names and numbers of the players on your tactics board, and all you have left is shapes. Those shapes can help you instruct; I can tell you where they are and where they might go, but they don't provide enough context.

<!---more--->

Even if I provide names, you don't know how much pace they have, how tall they are, how short, powerful, or agile they are. You don't know what they look like, and you can't see how well they perform by looking at that board.

It could be a team full of grown men versus a team of children on that board; you wouldn't know.
