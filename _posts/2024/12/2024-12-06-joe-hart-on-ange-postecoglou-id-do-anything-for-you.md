Joe Hart spoke about a conversation he had with then Celtic manager, Ange Postecoglou, before signing with the team. A conversation that showcases the class of man management that Tottenham has and why players will do anything for him.

> And then they've said, "Would you have a conversation with Ange Postecoglou?" I said, "Of course I would." I'm always open to conversations, completely open. Why not? I didn't know Ange; I didn't know his pedigree. I knew that he'd just become Celtic manager. Spoke to him, and it was a very, very, very honest conversation, especially from my point of view.
> 
> I said, "Look, please don't let me come across as defeatist, but I'm in a spot here where I don't know if I want to be a part of the professional world of football anymore." I said, "I'm not sad; I'm not down. I just don't feel I fit, and for me to fit," I said, "I need to be given a chance. I need to be understood, and I want the opportunity to play." I said, "Just please, listen to me when I say I'm not telling you to do that. I'm saying that's what I need to get the best out of me." 
> 
> Ange, an incredible, incredible man manager, he said, "You know what, I've done my research on you, so I'm not going to try and feel you out as a person." He said, "I've spoke to enough people about you for me to not have to even make a decision." He said, "Football-wise, I can't promise you anything, but I can promise you an opportunity. So if you do come up here, and you do want it, I feel like it could work." 
> 
> And I said, "Family-wise, football's not number one in our house anymore. So if I do come, I'm coming on my own." I said, "But you don't have to trust me. You don't know me, but just trust me that I'm all in. I'm completely all in, but I will be working between the two on days, two off, and things like that. So I don't want that to upset you, and if that's going to upset you and upset the balance in the dressing room, then I'm putting all my cards on the table."
> 
> And he said, "Look, look. I can't tell you how it's all going to work, but that's not a big no-no for me. I feel like we can start a relationship, and we can go from there."
> 
> Which I said, "That's enough; that's enough for me." That's enough. The fact that you're even willing to listen to my so-called demands—they're not demands, but like, what would really make me tick and potentially get the best out of me. I'd do anything for you. Let's do this.

And then he signed for Celtic from Tottenham.

You hear a lot from managers, at the highest levels of football, that as you go along it becomes more about managing people rather than the football or the tactics. A conversation like this one puts it into perspective.

Joe Hart was probably expecting him to say no, the moment he mentioned all that. But when you deal with human beings, there's more to factor in than just the football. You have to factor in the person. Factor in the person and, in his words, "I'd do anything for you. Let's do this."

We watch football for the people. Their stories. We could watch any other game and not be emotionally tied. We watch because of the emotion. They play or coach because of those same emotions.
