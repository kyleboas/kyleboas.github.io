The player that impressed me in the Manchester Derby was Noussair Mazraoui for Manchester United. Few defenders have guarded Jérémy Doku as effectively as he did. It was all in the position of his feet, to be first to face the ball after the challenge.

To prepare for the pivot to the left, see how Mazraoui points his left foot infield, away from his hips. He is preparing his body to pivot to the left as he engages in the challenge.

The first goal is to win the race to face the ball once he pivots. Let Doku win that battle, and he's gone because of his acceleration.

And then this is the important part.

In order to gain separation, Mazraoui needs momentum. In order to gain momentum, he needs to plant his right foot in the ground.

He won the battle on the turn, first to face the ball with his hips. Now he plants his foot quickly to launch towards the ball.

First he faces the ball with his hips, then he launches towards it. And he doesn't waste time; he doesn't wait for his right heel to make contact with the ground, he launches off his toes.

The entire movement is quick and seamless. He is being proactive by always positioning his feet to counter the direction of his hips, ready to turn to win the battle to the ball, and then he quickly plants the right foot to launch off his toes. Challenge won.

</figure>

Here, he has his left foot facing where he wants the ball to go as he makes the challenge, where he expects the ball to go. That way he simply has to move his trailing leg, the right leg, over to face the ball. Left leg stays pointed at the ball, trailing right leg makes that small move over to plant. He then quickly plants that right foot and launches off his toes towards the ball. 

[Most defenders](https://tacticsjournal.com/2023/11/23/watch-the-defenders-hips-and-opposite-foot-when-jeremy-doku-dribbles/) don't move at this speed, they would let Doku win the battle of the hips. The key is the hips and who wins the battle to face the ball. Mazraoui won that first battle to face the ball, which gave him the time to plant his feet and launch towards the ball before Doku even got his feet set.

And when you win the battle on the wings, and force a turnover, more often than not it will quickly lead to a high quality chance at the other end of the pitch. 

This was Manchester United's best chance of the entire game, and Bruno Fernandes nearly chipped Ederson to tie the game, 1-1. They would later go on to the win the game through a comedy of errors on City's part.
