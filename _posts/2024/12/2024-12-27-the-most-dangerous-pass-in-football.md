A low cross from the corner into the six-yard box with a forward attacking the near post, a forward attacking the middle of the six-yard box, and a player sneaking up on the back post has to be the most dangerous pass in football.

Major prerequisite: You must have someone that is good at crossing, but even the most inconsistent crossers can have success because this cross doesn't require perfect accuracy. Even an inaccurate cross can end up redirecting off an attacker or defender towards the back post.

The pass should be swung in at head height. Almost at the speed of a hard-hit shot. Putting a slight curve on the cross will help the player attacking the near and middle of the six-yard box to head the ball into the goal, and putting less curve on the cross will help them knock the ball on to the player attacking the back post.

If the crosser is accurate enough, teams can treat this cross like a set-piece rehearsed play to make it reproducible. That means they can involve players that would not normally end up in these positions, for example, a center-back. A center-back attacking the middle of the six-yard box sounds terrifying, and it will surprise the opponent.

The players attacking the front post and middle of the six-yard box will curve in towards the cross, whilst the player on the back post will curve their run away from the cross. 

It will be difficult for the defender, usually a fullback, to track the run of the player curving away on the back post because they will have their eyes on the cross. Every attacker and defender is moving towards the ball except for one, the player on the back post, who is sneakily moving away from the ball.

That back post run is what makes it dangerous because of the number of scenarios each run covers. They can head it directly in, flick it on, and the back post run will have a simple tap-in if the goalkeeper has a weak parry.
