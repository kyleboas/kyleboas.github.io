If we choreograph the way in which players move, are we giving them more room to think, or are they thinking more about the next pass or next move? Can we get it to where the entire team moves on autopilot, and will that create more opportunities to be creative?

A team that is not used to choreographed movements will play worse if they are forced to follow strict instructions. I believe that. They should at least, depending on the opponent they are playing against. No two games are the same. 

But if you practice something enough, if it works consistently, and it is reproducible, why would you not want to run that play every game? 

If you can run a play, pre-planned for open play, like teams do on a set piece, can it to a level in which there is no thinking required on the part of the player? What if you could plan for every action?

I don't think that is a good scenario to manufacture because the best players do. They don't need to tell you how they are going to do it, they just do it. And I would assume most can't verbalize why they are doing something. They know how to do something in the moment, and they adapt in real time. What makes them good is their ability to find a solution in the moment.

Other players can run plays, making minor adjustments to the route they are running within that play, reacting to how the opposition reacts to the play. But how do you include the players that perform better when they are able to find their own solutions? Do you exclude them, forcing them to adapt?

I think teams that do that will struggle more when there is adversity because they'll have to wait for the solution rather than creating their own solutions on the pitch, and the solution will come after the game, not during the game.
