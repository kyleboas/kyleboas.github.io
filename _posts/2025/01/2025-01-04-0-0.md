When you score the first goal, tell the rest of the team, "It's zero-zero." When you are up or the game is tied, treat it like you haven't scored. Stop reacting to the score and play the game.

I would put up my hands in the air to the rest of the team, in the shape of two zeros, nil nil. Forget the goal; treat it like the game just started.

If you have the mindset that you are up, you'll relax. You shouldn't want to relax. You should immediately want the next goal because it is zero-zero.
