The best strikers are driven by one thing, and they focus on goals. When others are thinking about defending, the build-up, crossing, maintaining possession, the focused striker thinks about the goal. A distracted striker can become ineffective.

Very few strikers can perform multiple tasks. Multiple tasks can become a distraction. You don't want their attention to be divided.

The distracted striker is moving with the rest of the team. Their eyes are focused where the rest of the team focuses. Their eyes are trained towards the ball. They are focused elsewhere on tasks outside of the penalty area.

The focused striker is studying the goalkeeper, the goal. They are peering over their shoulder at the goal, trying to spot areas they can attack a cross or a through ball. Every action they make is geared towards the shot or the header.

Some players are driven by defending, some are driven by passing, and at least one needs to be driven by goals. Once they get into the box, all the striker should be focused on is scoring.
