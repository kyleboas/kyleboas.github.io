I get a lot of inspiration from both questions and comments, especially when they are well thought out. That is why I have added a reply button to the blog below each post. I will respond, and we can go back and forth with ideas.

I can watch many games and find problems within them, but nothing speeds up that process of finding new problems more than a question because the question presents a problem to solve.

Send me your best problem, and I will try to solve it, or you can solve a problem I have.

One problem I have right now that you can solve: I want to know why we need holding midfielders when they are hard to come by. Can we allow them to go extinct?
