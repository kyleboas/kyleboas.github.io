I will no longer be posting on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. The decision to leave is being forced upon me due to the deteriation of the website.

<!---more--->

In my apolitical view: the site has been overun by crypto scams, porn bots, conspiracy theories, racism, misogyny. It is a haven for every form of lunacy and degenceray that you could imagine, and it has become nearly imposssible to have any productive conversations. It is a cesspool of rage baiting content made to drive engagment. It is an angry platform.

And then there is their targeted and increasingly rampant attack on external websites, like mine, through the disgusting practice of link suppression.

It started last year when I learned more about the site's increasing concerted effort to suppress links. Here is an example of how posting a link to X works:

First, I add a link to my blog post in an X post. I am sharing my hard work, something that should be celebrated by X because I am providing content to them for free.

When you post a link, X applies a link shortner to that link automatically. You can't remove it. The link changes from tacticsjournal.com to a t.co (Twitter) domain URL. 

When this was impleneted over a decade ago by the previous owners, the purpose for that link shortner was to provide stats to Twitter, to help them measure how many people click on that link, on their end. It was annoying because it caused the page to load slower. When you clicked on the link from Twitter, your browser will load the t.co link, then it has to redirect you to tacticsjournal.com. The difference in loading times compared to directly linking to the intended destination URL was minimal at the time.

Things changed in the past year or more.

In September of 2023, The Markup confirmed the fears many in the community had that X was throttling links using their link shortner. And not just throttling all links equally, which is bad enough as it is; they targeted any specfic domain name they liked like Bluesky, Facebook, Instagram, Substack, plus other news organizations.

[The Markup](https://themarkup.org/investigations/2023/09/15/twitter-is-still-throttling-competitors-links-check-for-yourself):

> On August 15, The Washington Post reported that X had slowed by about five seconds traffic to websites that had been criticized by owner Elon Musk, including the competing platforms identified by The Markup and media properties like The New York Times and Reuters. The Post also reported that X reversed some of the throttling after its story was published.
> 
> Slowing traffic to websites can harm the companies that run the sites and the people who use them. Even a 2.5-second delay after clicking a link can feel extremely slow to users, potentially discouraging them from waiting around for content to load. A 2017 Google study found that the probability of a user “bouncing,” or abandoning a site, increased 32% when page load times increased to three seconds from one second. Substack co-founders Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie, and Jairaj Seth wrote that they hope X reverses its decision to impose a delay on Substack links. “Writers cannot build sustainable businesses if their connection to their audience depends on unreliable platforms that have proven they are willing to make changes that are hostile to the people who use them,” they said in an email.  Meta and Bluesky did not respond to a request for comment. 

[The Markup ran tests](https://themarkup.org/investigations/2023/09/15/twitter-is-still-throttling-competitors-links-check-for-yourself), tests you can still run for yourself in that article I linked, that to this day slow down the loading speeds of links using their link shortner. You can notice right now when you are using X's website or app.

This practice to throttle links has been expanding since then. They can target whoever they like, the can decide to target all links theorteically. It has effected my blog and it lowers viewership greatly.

Once people learned about this, I thought that would be the turning point for everyone to leave X, but it wasn't.

X do not want people to leave to an external website because in their mind, that means the user will never come back. But the neferrarious targeted attacks on speific domains did not stop at just throttling links.

It has been confirmed by many sources, after X's alogrithm was made open-source, and [by Elon Musk himself](https://cybernews.com/news/musk-x-posts-with-links-suppression/), that X docks you points on your post, in their alogrithm, if you include a link. They limit it from being seen by your own followers and those that it could be recommended to. That shrinks your audience further and people miss posts because they simply don't show up in their feed.

What is the point of contributing to this website if my content is not valued and not being shared to the people that follow me or to a greater audience?

Now, finally, the exodus has begun not only because of this issue but also due to the deteriation of the site as a whole.

The European Federation of Journalists (EFJ), the largest organisation of journalists in Europe, representing over 295,000 journalists in 44 countries has announced that it will stop posting content on X.

[President of the EFJ, Maja Sever](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/media/european-federation-of-journalists-to-stop-posting-content-on-x-386598/):

> We cannot continue to participate in the social network feed of a man who proclaims the death of the media and therefore of journalists.
> 
> The social media site X has become the preferred vector for conspiracy theories, racism, far-right ideas and misogynistic rhetoric.

They join The Guardian and many other European news outlets:

> We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere.
> 
> This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism.

I made my final decison after [watching this video by YouTuber Hank Green](https://youtu.be/D4ghgVq9z4M?si=HJ2lrXv24d3HqTCe), where he compares engagment between Bluesky, Threads, and X further confirming everything I mentioned. If nothing changes, more and more people will leave in the coming months. Journalists and writers are leaving. News organizations are leaving. Creators are leaving. And then all they will be left with are those that enjoy a constant stream of chaos.

If I do want to get real-time news, now I go to Bluesky. A rapidly growing social media platform that has very early-Twitter vibes, is developer and creator friendly, and it supports the open web. They want you to share links. During the exodus that occured over the past two months, Bluesky's userbase has quickly grown to 26 million users. That is where everyone is going. The [football community](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k4wb5un5qj3yyvfjqg2ru7xa/lists/3latzdktcsb2p) is there, the [football tactics community](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k4wb5un5qj3yyvfjqg2ru7xa/lists/3latysx7vda23) is there, many other communities are moving there and deactivating their X accounts. The conversations are more civilized, they have better moderation organized by the community, and controlled by you not a company. Developers are flocking to Bluesky to create third-party apps, community run alogrithms, and more.

It is very hard to leave the 35,900 Twitter followers behind. I put in a lot of work to grow that audience, and I have a lot of relationships I'd like to keep. But I don't want to contribute to X's platform anymore.

Social media sites like X will come and go, but they have one thing in common: almost all of their owners are unlikeable. We get to choose who gets our time and attention. I have always advocated for creators to make their own blog, own your ideas and work. Don't rely social media to share and store your work.
