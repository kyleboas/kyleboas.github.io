Arsenal center-back William Saliba frees up thinking time for the rest of the team because of how consistent he is. The other players never have to worry because he always wins the ball, and he very rarely makes a mistake. You can quickly take for granted.

That feeling that when the ball is played in the air, and an attacker is running at his back, he is going to make the right decision and win the ball for the team.

Not many players, let alone defenders, offer you confidence that they can execute every action close to perfection. No worries.

Because you know he will make the right decision, the rest of the team can be planning for the next move, rather than having to factor in a possible mistake. 

That is a major advantage because you can count on one hand the amount of teams that have this type of player.
